    <div class="text"><p>Do you like eggs? I like eggs, especially my Eggleton, also known as Gudetama. <br>The name Gudetama combines the japanese phrase "gude gude" <br>which means lazy with "tama" a shortened word for tamago, which means egg. <br>He is a yolk that is most commonly know to lay on his egg whites and use a bacon blanket.</p></div>

    <div class="text"><p>I know your thinking, how can an egg be alive and better yet lazy? Well thats easily explained! <br>Its all thanks to eggleton magic and imagination. If you believe it you can see it.<br> But dont go getting an egg out of your refrigorator, because if that egg is left out it will spoil.<br> While Gudetama doesnt thanks to the latest eggleton magic technology.</p></div>

    <section><span class="text"><p>You may be wondering, Does Gudetama do different poses? Well the answer is yes! You see, <br>Gudetama is the master of disguise and posing. It was once said that Gudetama is the best spy <br>that has ever lived. But dont quote me these are just my eggsistential thoughts. </p></span></section>
